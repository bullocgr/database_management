### How to Run

Make sure you have the `main.cpp` file along with the `Emp.csv` and `Dept.csv` in the same folder.

Run the command `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main.out` to create the executable.
Run `./main.out` to execute the program. The joined file will be in `Join.csv`.

If you would like to see the results in the terminal run `cat Join.csv`.
